Far less research has addressed the unique problems of research planning. Models and maps of science that can address the detailed problems associated with research planning are needed. This article reports on the creation of an article-level model and map of science covering 16 years and nearly 20 million articles using cocitation-based techniques. The map is then used to define discipline-like structures consisting of natural groupings of articles and clusters of articles. This combination of detail and high-level structure can be used to address planning-related problems such as identification of emerging topics and the identification of which areas of science and technology are innovative and which are simply persisting. In addition to presenting the model and map, several process improvements that result in greater accuracy structures are detailed, including a bibliographic coupling approach for assigning current papers to cocitation clusters and a sequential hybrid approach to producing visual maps from models.",670-685,4,65

Full-text analysis offers the opportunity to significantly improve the quality of the signals upon which these co-citation models are based. In this work we study the effect of reference proximity on the accuracy of co-citation clusters. Using a corpus of 270,521 full text documents from 2007, we compare the results of traditional co-citation clustering using only the bibliographic information to results from co-citation clustering where proximity between reference pairs is factored into the pairwise relationships. We find that accounting for reference proximity from full text can increase the textual coherence (a measure of accuracy) of a co-citation cluster solution by up to 30% over the traditional approach based on bibliographic information.",1759-1767,9,64

A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories. Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those studies, although useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new gold standards—articles with at least 100 references—we find that direct citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.",984-998,4,68

Three different accuracy measures are employed, one based on references in authoritative documents, one using textual relatedness, and the last using document pairs linked by grants. We find that a hybrid relatedness measure based equally on direct citation and PubMed-related article scores gives more accurate clusters (in the aggregate) than the other relatedness measures tested. We also show that the differences in cluster contents between the different models are even larger than the differences in accuracy, suggesting that the textual and citation logics are complementary.

Such a relationship between researchers and journals is quantitatively exploited to identify scientific community clusters, by casting the community detection problem into a co-clustering problem on bipartite graphs. Such an approach has the potential of leading not only to the fine- grained detection of scholar communities based on the similarity of their research activity, but also to the clustering of scientific journals based on which are the most representative of each community. The proposed methodology is purely data-driven and completely unsupervised, and does not rely on any semantics (e.g. keywords or a-priori subjective categories). Moreover, unlike “flat” data structures (e.g. collaboration graphs or citation graphs) our bipartite graph approach blends in a joint structure both the researcher's attitude and interests (i.e., freedom to select the venue where to publish) as well as the community's recognition (i.e., acceptance of the publication on a target journal); as such may perhaps inspire further scientometric evaluation strategies. Our proposed approach is applied to the Italian research system, for two broad areas (ICT and Microbiology&Genetics), and reveals some questionable aspects and community overlaps in the current Italian scientific sectors classification.",354-386,1,13

From this basic principle we deduce a set of main indicators, particularly for the assessment of research output and international impact. Important elements include new approaches for identifying fields and research themes on the basis of a publication-level rather than a journal-level network; publication and citation counting; normalization of citation measures; the use of indicators based on averages versus those based on citation distributions; and weighting procedures and statistical reliability.

Here we present an easily reproducible method to perform reclassification of the Web of Science into existing subject categories and into 14 broad areas. Our reclassification is at the level of articles, so it preserves disciplinary differences that may exist among individual articles published in the same journal.

Most maps of science, including overlay maps, are flat in the sense that they visualize research fields at one single level. Such maps generally fail to provide both overview and detail about the research being analyzed. The aim of this study is to improve overlay maps of science to provide both features in a single visualization. I created a map based on a hierarchical classification of publications, including broad disciplines for overview and more granular levels to incorporate detailed information.

To create a local map, one defines and directly maps a sample of data, such as all literature published in a set of information science journals. To create a global map of a research field, one maps “all of science” and then locates a literature sample within that full context. We provide a deductive argument that global mapping should create more accurate partitions of a research field than does local mapping, followed by practical reasons why this may not be so. The field of information science is then mapped at the document level using both local and global methods to provide a case illustration of the differences between the methods. Textual coherence is used to assess the accuracies of both maps. We find that document clusters in the global map have significantly higher coherence than do those in the local map, and that the global map provides unique insights into the field of information science that cannot be discerned from the local map. Specifically, we show that information science and computer science have a large interface and that computer science is the more progressive discipline at that interface. We also show that research communities in temporally linked threads have a much higher coherence than do isolated communities, and that this feature can be used to predict which threads will persist into a subsequent year.

Several citation factors have been studied in the literature. In this study we propose a new factor, topic growth, that no previous study has studied empirically. The growth rate of topics may influence future citation counts because a high growth in a topic means there are more publications citing previous publications in that topic. We construct topics using community detection in a citation network and use a two-part regression model to study the association between topic growth and citation counts in eight broad disciplines. The first part of the model uses quantile regression to estimate the effect of growth ratio on citation counts for publications with more than three citations. The second part of the model uses logistic regression to model the influence of the explanatory variables on the probability of being lowly cited versus being modestly or highly cited. Both models control for three variables that may distort the association between the topic growth and citations: journal impact, number of references, and number of authors. The regression model clearly shows that publications in fast-growing topics have a citation advantage compared to publications in slow-growing or declining topics in all of the eight disciplines. Using citation indicators for research evaluation may give incentives for researchers to publish in fast-growing topics, but they may cause research to be less diversified. The results have also some implications for citation normalization.",1903-1921,4,127

While most classifications systems are implemented at the journal level, their accuracy has been questioned, and paper-level classifications have been considered by many to be more precise. However, few studies investigated the difference between journal and the paper classification systems. This study addresses this gap by comparing the journal- and paper-level classifications for the same set of papers and journals. This isolates the effects of classification precision (i.e., journal- or paper-level) to reveal the extent of paper misclassification. Results show almost half of papers could be misclassified in journal classification systems. Given their importance in the construction and analysis of bibliometric indicators, more attention should be given to the robustness and accuracy of these disciplinary classifications schemes.",202-225,1,13

In this paper, we compared the classification of publications in Nature based on three different approaches across three different systems. These were: Web of Science (WoS) subject categories (SCs) provided by InCites, which are based on the disciplinary affiliation of the majority of a paper’s references; Fields of Research (FoR) classification provided by Dimensions, which are derived from machine learning techniques; and subjects classification provided by Springer Nature, which are based on author-selected subject terms in the publisher’s tagging system. The results show, first, that the single category assignment in InCites is not appropriate for a large number of papers. Second, only 27% of papers share the same fields between FoR classification in Dimensions and subjects classification in Springer Nature, revealing great inconsistencies between these machine-determined versus human-judged approaches. Being aware of the characteristics and limitations of the ways we categorize research publications is important to research management.",,,

How to label the classes in these classifications is a problem that has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. In this study, we evaluate different approaches to label the classes in algorithmically constructed classifications of research publications. We focus on two important choices: the choice of (a) different bibliographic fields and (b) different approaches to weight the relevance of terms. To evaluate the different choices, we created two baselines: one based on the Medical Subject Headings in MEDLINE and another based on the Science-Metrix journal classification. We tested to what extent different approaches yield the desired labels for the classes in the two baselines. Based on our results, we recommend extracting terms from titles and keywords to label classes at high levels of granularity (e.g., topics). At low levels of granularity (e.g., disciplines) we recommend extracting terms from journal names and author addresses. We recommend the use of a new approach, term frequency to specificity ratio, to calculate the relevance of terms.",853-869,7,72

We propose a principled methodology for evaluating the accuracy of clustering solutions obtained using these relatedness measures. We formally show that the proposed methodology has an important consistency property. The empirical analyses that we present are based on publications in the fields of cell biology, condensed matter physics, and economics. Using the BM25 text-based relatedness measure as the evaluation criterion, we find that bibliographic coupling relations yield more accurate clustering solutions than direct citation relations and cocitation relations. The so-called extended direct citation approach performs similarly to or slightly better than bibliographic coupling in terms of the accuracy of the resulting clustering solutions. The other way around, using a citation-based relatedness measure as evaluation criterion, BM25 turns out to yield more accurate clustering solutions than other text-based relatedness measures.",691-713,2,1
Y65AV3EQ,preprint,2016,"Leydesdorff, Loet; Bornmann, Lutz; Zhou, Ping",Construction of a Pragmatic Base Line for Journal Classifications and Maps Based on Aggregated Journal-Journal Citation Relations,,,,,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02716,"A number of journal classification systems have been developed in bibliometrics since the launch of the Citation Indices by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) in the 1960s. These systems are used to normalize citation counts with respect to field-specific citation patterns. The best known system is the so-called ""Web-of-Science Subject Categories"" (WCs). In other systems papers are classified by algorithmic solutions. Using the Journal Citation Reports 2014 of the Science Citation Index and the Social Science Citation Index (n of journals = 11,149), we examine options for developing a new system based on journal classifications into subject categories using aggregated journal-journal citation data. Combining routines in VOSviewer and Pajek, a tree-like classification is developed. At each level one can generate a map of science for all the journals subsumed under a category. Nine major fields are distinguished at the top level. Further decomposition of the social sciences is pursued for the sake of example with a focus on journals in information science (LIS) and science studies (STS). The new classification system improves on alternative options by avoiding the problem of randomness in each run that has made algorithmic solutions hitherto irreproducible. Limitations of the new system are discussed (e.g. the classification of multi-disciplinary journals). The system's usefulness for field-normalization in bibliometrics should be explored in future studies.",,,

A case study comparing an internal and an external mapping of the topical structure of invasion biology,,,,,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03485,"In our paper we seek to address a shortcoming in the scientometric literature, namely that, given the proliferation of algorithmic approaches to topic detection from bibliometric data, there is a relative lack of studies that validate and create a deeper understanding of the topical structures these algorithmic approaches generate. To take a closer look at this issue, we investigate the results of the new Leiden algorithm when applied to the direct citation network of a field-level data set. We compare this internal perspective which is constructed from the citation links within a data set of 30,000 publications in invasion biology, with an external perspective onto the topic structures in this research specialty, which is based on a global science map in form of the CWTS microfield classification underlying the Leiden Ranking. We present an initial comparative analysis of the results and lay out our next steps that will involve engaging with domain experts to examine how the algorithmically identified topics relate to understandings of topics and topical perspectives that operate within this research specialty.",,,
